<h2 id="Research-gaps-between-manufacturing-systems-and-Industry-4-0"><a href="#Research-gaps-between-manufacturing-systems-and-Industry-4-0" class="headerlink" title="Research gaps between manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0"></a>Research gaps between manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0</h2><p>The manufacturing system is an integration between equipment and labour resources, which carries out one or more production action from the material, part or set of parts. The manufacturing system is influenced by many different factors, which are ‘types of operations’, ‘number of workstations’, ‘automation level’, and ‘system flexibility’. Based on these factors, six general types of a manufacturing system are defined as ‘single-station manned cells’, ‘single-station automated cells’, ‘manual assembly system’, ‘automated assembly system’, ‘cellular manufacturing system’ and ‘flexible manufacturing system’ (Groover, 2007). Besides these six typical manufacturing systems, there are many other manufacturing systems defined by engineers, such as computer-integrated manufacturing system, reconfigurable manufacturing system, etc. With these fundamental manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 has been conceived.</p>
<p><strong>•    Single-station automated cell</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to the manned cell, the automated cell is fully automated. The machines used are not attended by any workers during more than one machine cycle. The labour cost has decreased, and, productivity has increased compared with the manned cell. However, this system also targets on constant product batches (Xu and Newman, 2006). A typical single-station automated cell is made up of one or more automated machine (a machine cluster) and an automated loading and unloading system, such as robots, conveyors, etc. The CNC machine centre system is a common example of this system, which can change the tool, position the product and change the pallet automatically. It can work with a loading robot or feeding system to load or unload the products.</p>
<p><strong>•    Automated assembly system</strong> </p>
<p>Increased manufacturing production has been built in the assembly automation. Compared to the manual assembly system, this system uses a handling system (usually industrial robots) to replace the workers’ jobs. A fully automated assembly system is fixed, which is designed to carry out a fixed order of assembly schedule on a specific product. It requires the system to be highly stable without changing the product design during production, which means the components of the system are limited (Webbink and Hu, 2005). However, this system undertakes very high product demand, normally considered in the millions. The components of the system are similar to those of the manual system, but with two important parts replacing workers, the handling system and the feeding system. In addition, the control includes sequence control, safety monitoring, and quality control which is also automated. Depending on the special requirement, the application of this system is not many as the manual system. One of the most common applications of automated assembly systems is in the machining of sheet metal forming and cutting, rolling mill operations, spot welding, plating operation, etc. </p>
<p><strong>•    Flexible manufacturing system</strong></p>
<p>The flexible manufacturing system is a highly automated application of ‘group technology’, of which flexibility is the core feature. However, a flexible manufacturing system is designed for a specific part family, which is not completely flexible. In this system, several workstations are connected to an automated transport feeder system, controlled by a distributed computer system. Every workpiece is identified during the entire production cycle, which is able to change the processing immediately. Therefore, in this system, the machine, and material utilization is increasingly improved with a small number of employees and system space, which also reduces the inventory requirements. In addition, with the high flexibility, the system can make the quick responsiveness needed for the changeover. With the advancement of the flexible manufacturing system, machining application, such as the milling and drilling operations, benefit the most.</p>
<p><strong>•    Computer-integrated manufacturing system</strong>  </p>
<p>The computer-integrated manufacturing system was firstly claimed in 1973 by Joseph Harrington. However, it did not attract engineers’ attention until 1984 when the computer and automated system began to be developed in manufacturing. The computer-integrated manufacturing system is a completely automated manufacturing, where the computers control all functions (Wolf, 2018). An ideal computer-integrated manufacturing system implies the factory level automation from design, materials management to the production line and distribution.  In addition, the simplest system is required at least two integrated computers that exchange the information. In this system, the production can response rapidly with less error. Also, the most important capability of this system is cooperative automation.</p>
<p><strong>•    Reconfigurable manufacturing system</strong></p>
<p>The reconfigurable manufacturing system is designed for adjusting the abrupt changes of the market or another requirement within the same part family. This system tends to claim six capabilities: modularity, integrability customization, convertibility, scalability and diagnosability. However, a typical reconfigurable manufacturing system does not need to achieve all of these capabilities, and, the current applications of the system have achieved several of these characteristics. The typical system requires the CNC machines, reconfigurable machine tools, reconfigurable inspections machines and material transport system. Additionally, this system is different with the flexible manufacturing system (Bortolini et al., 2018). The flexible manufacturing system focuses on the expanding the producing range of the system.  The reconfigurable manufacturing system aim at increasing the changing response of different requirement or situation, which means this system play more attention on the customized flexibility rather than production flexibility(Koren et al., 2018).<br>|   |<br>| — |<br>Analysing the current manufacturing system and comparing them with the concepts of the Industry 4.0, Above figure can represent the ‘gaps’ between current manufacturing systems and the Industry 4.0. In this figure, only the recently automated manufacturing systems (single-station automated cell, automated assembly system, flexible manufacturing system, computer-integrated manufacturing system and reconfigurable manufacturing system) are involved because Industry 4.0 is discussed on the digital level manufacturing. In addition, this figure only reflects the general characteristics of the manufacturing system. Some special examples of manufacturing system may have more concepts, which are not included in this figure.</p>
<p>According to the above figure, it is obvious that the current manufacturing has not achieved Industry 4.0 level comprehensively although many researchers and companies are working on this topic. Every current manufacturing system is able to cover some of the Industry 4.0 concepts, mainly is concentrated in interoperability. The single-station automated cell is digital and connected to achieve the capability of flexibility. The current automated assembly system hardly becomes standardized, which is accomplished by the computer-integrated manufacturing system. For the flexible manufacturing system and reconfigurable manufacturing system, customers can order almost products depending their own ideas. </p>
<p>However, the current flexible manufacturing system has not become real-time response entirely. However, as the most advanced system, the flexible manufacturing system, and the Reconfigurable manufacturing system are closest to Industry 4.0. In Figure 3.1, most of the systems rarely achieve concepts of the intelligent that are the main research aim of the Industry 4.0 development neither Industry 4.0 lower nor upper. These concepts of research gap are the main developing direction of the Industry 4.0 research.</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go to improve manufacturing up to the required level to match all concepts with all dimensions, especially consciousness, which is the main aim and objective of this research. Moreover, industry and academia demand a complete structure of these technology applications to show the development of manufacturing with the different levels of performance, which will be introduced in Chapter 3. AM is one of the most popular applications of Industry 4.0. Although AM systems tend to become increasingly automated and worry less, the issue of energy consumption still attracts attention, even in the ear of Industry 4.0. In next section, the AM technologies and its energy consumption will be introduced for understanding the AM process and energy consumption states.</p>

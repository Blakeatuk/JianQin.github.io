<h3 id="Research-Experiences"><a href="#Research-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Research Experiences"></a>Research Experiences</h3><p><strong>â€¢    Additive manufacturing and advanced data analytics</strong></p>
<p>The applicant formally started his Ph.D. research from 2015 in Mechanical Manufacturing at Cardiff University. His Ph.D. project aims to model, predict, and optimise the energy consumption for <strong>AM systems</strong> based on the <strong>Internet of things (IoT)</strong> technologies and advanced data analytics. The main objective is to sense, collect and integrate <strong>multi-source data</strong> from process, design, environment, and material to build the energy consumption prediction modelling, and then reduce the energy consumption by optimising the design relevant features.  He designed and developed an <strong>IoT-based process monitoring platform</strong> the working environment which integrated with the data collected from the target AM system. The IoT technology is applied in this project extensively, including extra data sensing and collection, <strong>wireless communication</strong>, and <strong>edge data pre-processing</strong>. In this project, two energy consumption modelling approaches were proposed based on multi-source data and design-relevant data. These two modelling approaches incorporated clustering techniques and <strong>deep learning</strong> to integrate the multi-source data and design-relevant data, and then to build the energy consumption prediction models for AM systems. Moreover, an energy consumption optimisation approach was also proposed focusing on the AM part design and process planning, which the <strong>particle swarm optimisation</strong> was improved by deep learning technology. A set of optimisations suggesting is generated for AM part designers, process operators, and manufactures.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Internet of things</strong></p>
<p>Another research interest is the <strong>Internet of things (IoT)</strong>. The applicant keens in learning and discovering the knowledge of IoT. The applicant won an <strong>IoT competition award</strong>, which provided full funding for achieving one of his research proposals. This competition was hosted and organised by Jisc. The project aimed to build the intelligent campus, and improve student satisfaction, recognition and living experience of university, this project built a <strong>smart IoT system</strong> to deliver the accessible university facilities, such as IoT-enable chairs and desks in public forum and <strong>IoT-enable discuss zone</strong> in the library, to students. Each IoT device of the system collected the status data of the targeted facility in <strong>real-time</strong>. The collected raw data was preprocessed at local devices, and the pre-processed data was then uploaded to the target cloud server via the <strong>LoRa gateway</strong>. The availabilities of university facilities and relevant knowledge was further analysed and discovered on the cloud, which can provide university students the utilisation and management of the accessible resources.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Processing monitoring, controlling and optimisation</strong> </p>
<p>He started his research from the final project of his MSc degree at the University of Bath, which focused on robotic system process monitoring, controlling and optimisation. The project is named <strong>â€˜Feed-Forward Controller Design for Vibration Suppression in Motion Control Robotic Systemsâ€™</strong>. This project proved and improved the theories of input shapers which can <strong>reduce the vibration</strong> of the object carried a robot. The theories were simulated by <strong>MATLAB software</strong>, and validation experimental was designed and tested on a <strong>KUKA industrial robot</strong>. The results of the <strong>simulation</strong> and <strong>experiment</strong> can justify the function of input shaper in vibration suppression of the robotic systems. During simulation and experimental test, some problems appeared, and appropriate solutions to address these problems were given. This project compares and analyses the results of simulation and experiments objectively. He has worked in two industrial companies for <strong>monitoring</strong> and <strong>controlling system design</strong> and <strong>development</strong>. He was involved in a robot design and development for design the <strong>structure of gripper and the monitoring system</strong> on the gripper. Another recent project he has joined is to develop a new product for an industrial company, which is an <strong>intelligent monitoring and controlling system</strong> for manufacturing process. This IoT based data sensing, collection and process platform is self-configurating. When sensors are connected to the platform, the platform can find the IP address automatically and start to collect data from sensor.     </p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Outcome delivery</strong></p>
<p>Until now, the applicant has published <strong>three journal paper</strong>, <strong>four conference paper and six patents</strong>. The quality and the impact of the research outputs produced in his early-stage career is suggested by the <strong>299</strong> citations that they are received from the international research community to date. From 2016 until now, he has attended <strong>four international academic conferences</strong>. On every conference, he presented his research either by the oral presentation and the poster.  Additionally, the applicant has been the <strong>reviewer</strong> for many academic journals, such as Journal of Mechanical Design (ASME), Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering (ASME), and Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing and conferences, such as ASME 2019 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences (IDETC 2019) and IEEE 2019 International Conference on Automation Science, publication job. The applicant has a strong ability and significant experience in the <strong>academic report, and paper writing</strong>. Furthermore, he has proved his skills in delivering the research outcomes by different methods, such as <strong>verbal presentation, poster, and industrial seminar speaking</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the projects he has joined, that shown above, the ability of time management, conceptualise and understand the commercial imperative for the project, problem-solving, and project management has been proved by the applicant.</p>

The manufacturing system is influenced by many different factors, which are â€˜types of operationsâ€™, â€˜number of workstationsâ€™, â€˜automation levelâ€™, and â€˜system flexibilityâ€™. Based on these factors, six general types of a manufacturing system are defined as â€˜single-station manned cellsâ€™, â€˜single-station automated cellsâ€™, â€˜manual assembly systemâ€™, â€˜automated assembly systemâ€™, â€˜cellular manufacturing systemâ€™ and â€˜flexible manufacturing systemâ€™ (Groover, 2007). Besides these six typical manufacturing systems, there are many other manufacturing systems defined by engineers, such as computer-integrated manufacturing system, reconfigurable manufacturing system, etc. With these fundamental manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 has been conceived.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Single-station automated cell</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to the manned cell, the automated cell is fully automated. The machines used are not attended by any workers during more than one machine cycle. The labour cost has decreased, and, productivity has increased compared with the manned cell. However, this system also targets on constant product batches (Xu and Newman, 2006). A typical single-station automated cell is made up of one or more automated machine (a machine cluster) and an automated loading and unloading system, such as robots, conveyors, etc. The CNC machine centre system is a common example of this system, which can change the tool, position the product and change the pallet automatically. It can work with a loading robot or feeding system to load or unload the products.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Automated assembly system</strong> </p>
<p>Increased manufacturing production has been built in the assembly automation. Compared to the manual assembly system, this system uses a handling system (usually industrial robots) to replace the workersâ€™ jobs. A fully automated assembly system is fixed, which is designed to carry out a fixed order of assembly schedule on a specific product. It requires the system to be highly stable without changing the product design during production, which means the components of the system are limited (Webbink and Hu, 2005). However, this system undertakes very high product demand, normally considered in the millions. The components of the system are similar to those of the manual system, but with two important parts replacing workers, the handling system and the feeding system. In addition, the control includes sequence control, safety monitoring, and quality control which is also automated. Depending on the special requirement, the application of this system is not many as the manual system. One of the most common applications of automated assembly systems is in the machining of sheet metal forming and cutting, rolling mill operations, spot welding, plating operation, etc. </p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Flexible manufacturing system</strong></p>
<p>The flexible manufacturing system is a highly automated application of â€˜group technologyâ€™, of which flexibility is the core feature. However, a flexible manufacturing system is designed for a specific part family, which is not completely flexible. In this system, several workstations are connected to an automated transport feeder system, controlled by a distributed computer system. Every workpiece is identified during the entire production cycle, which is able to change the processing immediately. Therefore, in this system, the machine, and material utilization is increasingly improved with a small number of employees and system space, which also reduces the inventory requirements. In addition, with the high flexibility, the system can make the quick responsiveness needed for the changeover. With the advancement of the flexible manufacturing system, machining application, such as the milling and drilling operations, benefit the most.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Computer-integrated manufacturing system</strong>  </p>
<p>The computer-integrated manufacturing system was firstly claimed in 1973 by Joseph Harrington. However, it did not attract engineersâ€™ attention until 1984 when the computer and automated system began to be developed in manufacturing. The computer-integrated manufacturing system is a completely automated manufacturing, where the computers control all functions (Wolf, 2018). An ideal computer-integrated manufacturing system implies the factory level automation from design, materials management to the production line and distribution.  In addition, the simplest system is required at least two integrated computers that exchange the information. In this system, the production can response rapidly with less error. Also, the most important capability of this system is cooperative automation.</p>
<p><strong>â€¢    Reconfigurable manufacturing system</strong></p>
<p>The reconfigurable manufacturing system is designed for adjusting the abrupt changes of the market or another requirement within the same part family. This system tends to claim six capabilities: modularity, integrability customization, convertibility, scalability and diagnosability. However, a typical reconfigurable manufacturing system does not need to achieve all of these capabilities, and, the current applications of the system have achieved several of these characteristics. The typical system requires the CNC machines, reconfigurable machine tools, reconfigurable inspections machines and material transport system. Additionally, this system is different with the flexible manufacturing system (Bortolini et al., 2018). The flexible manufacturing system focuses on the expanding the producing range of the system.  The reconfigurable manufacturing system aim at increasing the changing response of different requirement or situation, which means this system play more attention on the customized flexibility rather than production flexibility(Koren et al., 2018).</p>

<td>Analysing the current manufacturing system and comparing them with the concepts of the Industry 4.0, Above figure can represent the â€˜gapsâ€™ between current manufacturing systems and the Industry 4.0. In this figure, only the recently automated manufacturing systems (single-station automated cell, automated assembly system, flexible manufacturing system, computer-integrated manufacturing system and reconfigurable manufacturing system) are involved because Industry 4.0 is discussed on the digital level manufacturing. In addition, this figure only reflects the general characteristics of the manufacturing system. Some special examples of manufacturing system may have more concepts, which are not included in this figure.</td>

<p>According to the above figure, it is obvious that the current manufacturing has not achieved Industry 4.0 level comprehensively although many researchers and companies are working on this topic. Every current manufacturing system is able to cover some of the Industry 4.0 concepts, mainly is concentrated in interoperability. The single-station automated cell is digital and connected to achieve the capability of flexibility. The current automated assembly system hardly becomes standardized, which is accomplished by the computer-integrated manufacturing system. For the flexible manufacturing system and reconfigurable manufacturing system, customers can order almost products depending their own ideas. </p>
<p>However, the current flexible manufacturing system has not become real-time response entirely. However, as the most advanced system, the flexible manufacturing system, and the Reconfigurable manufacturing system are closest to Industry 4.0. In Figure 3.1, most of the systems rarely achieve concepts of the intelligent that are the main research aim of the Industry 4.0 development neither Industry 4.0 lower nor upper. These concepts of research gap are the main developing direction of the Industry 4.0 research.</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go to improve manufacturing up to the required level to match all concepts with all dimensions, especially consciousness, which is the main aim and objective of this research. Moreover, industry and academia demand a complete structure of these technology applications to show the development of manufacturing with the different levels of performance, which will be introduced in Chapter 3. AM is one of the most popular applications of Industry 4.0. Although AM systems tend to become increasingly automated and worry less, the issue of energy consumption still attracts attention, even in the ear of Industry 4.0. In next section, the AM technologies and its energy consumption will be introduced for understanding the AM process and energy consumption states.</p>
